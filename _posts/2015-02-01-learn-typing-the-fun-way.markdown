Many a times in our lives we ignore lot of small things which we can actually improve up on. 

To demonstrate how such small things affect our life, lets consider your current potential to be 1. If you improve up on it by 1% it becomes 1.01, if you decrease it comes down to 0.99. Not much of a difference right? Now, how about we doing the mistake every day for an year? 

![Improving 1% a day for 365 days vs deteriorating 1% a day for 365 days](/resources/improvedaily.jpg "Improve yourself") 

<br/>
Aah! Now that's something we should care about! Isn't it? Even if we are not deteriorating we will stay at 1. Still making a lot of difference. So this is one reason it is very important we improve daily. 

One thing I feel very much neglected is our typing speed. I have experience with lots of people not caring about the time spent (wasted I would say) in typing or correcting the mistakes they do while typing. Again the same formulae applies to everything. Computers have become an integral part of our lives and especially people whose job completely relies on computer are in great need to improve up on their typing skills.

Small Analysis
--------------
I just typed this quote competing with 2 random strangers: 

> "I believe in love, and I know that you do too. And I believe in some kind of path that we can walk down, me and you. So keep your candles burning and make her journey bright and pure." 

Results: 

- 74 wpm - 27 sec (My score :P)
- 38 wpm - 59 sec (Random person 1 - R1)
- 23 wpm - 90 sec (Random person 2 - R2)

Now that's just for 3 sentences. Time wasted by R1 is 32 seconds, R2 is 63 seconds. 
Considering on an average we type 30 sentences per day (Random generalization).  R1 wastes 320 sec and R2, 630 sec per day. Now per year? **R1 - 32.4 Hrs and R2 - 63.8 Hrs per year!** Now this is considering 30 sentences per day. 

Important points to remember 
----------------------------
If you really want to learn typing properly you should follow these important steps

- Your [finger positioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXsutlz0GIQ) while typing. 
- Don't look at the keys when you type.
- Do not rush when you just started learning. (Be Patient!) 

Type Racer

Now, it is boring to go with those typing tutorials to type the KG poems it instructs us to type. So there is this fun way I use when I am bored of my work or when I need some break, it is [typeracer.com](http://play.typeracer.com)

Here, every player(typer) is assigned a car and the speed of your car depends on your typing speed. You can compete with other typers or among your firends. Its really fun and a good way to learn typing. They provide us with very interesting quotes or sentences picked from famous books. This way you are reading some books as well. 
Best way I would say. Happy Typing Guys!

Here are [some interesting infographics](http://www.ratatype.com/learn/average-typing-speed/) on typing.
