A very happy new year to everyone! One more year passed by and I guess everyone's mind is filled with one important question, "Should I do change something in me this year?" #NewYearResolution

So yeah I would also like to make a list of resolutions or targets I would like to change or accomplish this year. So here we go: 


Resolutions
-----------
- Blog regularly!
- Stop postponing stuff (Finish the job there and then!)

Targets
-------
- Complete [DSA-1 Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) in Coursera!
- Get rid of my belly fat & flatten it - [How to](http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Your-Belly)
- Learn how to play a music instrument - [Tabla]()


Except the music instrument, I had all the above resolutions & targets last year as well. But I failed! I don't wnat to fail again, that is the reason I am writing it here. 
I guess, the one main resolution for this year is to make the following quote true in my life.

>Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.
