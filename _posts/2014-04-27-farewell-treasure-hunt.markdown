Last few days of my college life, a bit of psenti feeling that I am never going to come back to this place. Admist this feeling, there came the SAP farewell. We(Arpeet, sarabasti & me) conducted a treasure hunt to all the 3rd & 4th yearites. We were ready with the plan more than a week back, but most of the work was done just an hour before the event, afterall we are Bitsians! 

We met at 5pm and quickly rushed to IPC planning what all to be done. We quickly started documenting the clues, thinking on the incomplete ones & rushed to c'not to get them printed. I could clearly see the feeling in each of us that we should bid a perfect farewell to our seniors (technically juniors to me :P). While planning for the event, all I wondered was about a simple question, "Will they be excited to play this?". My notion that SAP people are not enthusiastic (developed since my first year), broke the moment I saw people rushing out with their clues in the first round. By the time I reached my next position I almost got 3 calls. I was very excited seeing their response. I called arpeet, basti regularly to enquire about the status of the event. I enjoyed a lot conducting the whole event. Manaswi, the inquisitive guy called me the most. Feels good to see that this man enjoyed it a lot. His epic "Maza agaya yaar" made my day. Felt cool that everything went well. 

After having dinner we went to t-lawns. It is time to express the psenti feeling. Manaswi, though he tried to feel 'psenti' the group didn't let him. He started talking about each person(only the positives). I wonder why he chose this order - 3rd, 2nd, 1st, 5th yearites. Then Anjal Khan (KhanChacha) spoke. He was too direct, right to the point and no bullshit. No 'aa..', 'ee..' gaps in his speech. He has his own style of expressing his views. He chose to start with pogo and continued in the order of seating. Then juniors presented scrap books & gifts to the psentisemites. Shocked to see they made one for me as well. 

Had a wonderful time and +1 memory to my bitsian life. Thank you guys.

This reminds me of one of the famous quotes of APJ Abdul kalam on memories- 
>Sometimes it’s better to bunk a class and enjoy with friends, because today when I look back, marks never make me laugh, but memories do…
