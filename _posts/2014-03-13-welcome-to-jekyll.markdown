Hello! 
This is Pavan Kotesh a.k.a Pako. The name "Pako" came out of sheer laziness of bitsians. I being lazy choose to name my website as "PAKOMAN". Crazy! isn't it?

This is my blog and I will soon be updating all the details. I am still in the process of updating and tweeking the design. Please stay tuned till then. Do come back, may be after a week. Everything will be alright here by then ;)
