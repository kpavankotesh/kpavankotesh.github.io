It has been 5 days since I joined my job. It is all so different from college. It is you who have to take care of each and every thing in your life. I miss those days in college. Having friends always around, mainly no responsibilities at all! BITS is one place which gave me loads of freedom to explore this world. In real world it feels as if all the freedom is lost and you are bound to do many things. Miss pilani so much that I want to leave everything and go back to pilani!
